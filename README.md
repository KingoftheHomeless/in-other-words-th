# in-other-words-th

This package provides the template haskell functions `makeEff` and `makeEff_` for less boilerplate when using in-other-words.

# Acknowledgments
This package is copied almost verbatim from [`polysemy`](https://github.com/polysemy-research/polysemy) and was adapted to in-other-words by Valentin Herrmann.
